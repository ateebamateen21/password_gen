//How to make a password generator in React

[Make Interface using react component]

--(It's a simple app, you can directly make it in the App.jsx (or maybe create an other component if you want))

-- Make a div container with three subcontainers  

-- First sub-container> heading , second> input field with button, third> One range input + two checkboxes (one for numbers and other for characters) - to ask the user whether to add chars or nums to password or not?

--That's it!

[Do styling (!your choice)]

--Jo dil kare karo (Do what you want!)

[Manage states of elements]

-- Following elements will have their states managed by useState() hook. 
-Password input field




--ONE STRATEGY I DIDN'T FINISH OR ADD:
(Sorry should've posted in the repo.)
  const generatePassword = useCallback(()=>{
    let charCodes = [];
    if(includeNumbers){
      charCodes = charCodes.concat(numberCodes);
    }
    if(includeCharacters){
      charCodes = charCodes.concat(characterCodes);
    }
    const passwordCharacters = [];
    for(let i = 0; i < passwordLength; i++){
      const characterCode = charCodes[Math.floor(Math.random() * charCodes.length)];
      passwordCharacters.push(String.fromCharCode(characterCode));
    }
    setPassword(passwordCharacters.join(''));

  },[includeNumbers, includeCharacters, passwordLength, setPassword])
